""" FILE NAME: 'sample_cov_placement.py'
    DESCRIPTION: This file is implementing the sensor positioning solution proposed
    by Krause, Singh and Guestrin (2008) on the MAGIC testside in Elephant and Castle.
    This implementation uses a sample calculated that is calculated after applying PCA
    on the timesteps. 95% of the variance is hereby preserved.
