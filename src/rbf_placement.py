""" FILE NAME: 'rbf_placement.py'
    DESCRIPTION: This file is implementing the sensor positioning solution proposed
    by Krause, Singh and Guestrin (2008) on the MAGIC testside in Elephant and Castle.
    This is a simple implementation that uses the RBF kernel instead of a non-stationary
    estimated kernel as will be done in the final model.
